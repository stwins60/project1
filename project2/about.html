    <p>My name is Idris Fagbemi, I was born in Lagos State, Nigeria. I am from the western part of Nigeria
      (Yoruba). I was born into the family of 6, which am the second child.</p>

      <p>My college life was a bit challenging because i had difficulties adjusting to the educational system. I graduated from Truman College in 2017
        with a GPA of 3.7, with High Honor.</p>
        <p>While at Truman college, I joined Phi theta Kappa in 2017, and I received 3 Honor of Dean List and a presidential scholar.</p>
        <p>I got admission to the Illinois Institute of Technology as a third year undergraduate to gain a bachelor of science in Information Technology Management.</p>
        <p>To be able to achieve all I have now, I will not a hesitate mention my family that are so supportive. My mum, my two uncles and my aunt.</p>
        <p>They taught me about what life they have given me, how they want me to be educated and be a man that will be part of a progressive society.</p>
        <p>Life have been kind of easy for me because i have families who i rely on to guide me, so i can be able to accomplish my set goals.</p>
        <p>My set goal is to become a web designer and application developer, so i contribute to my country and the society at large.</p>
